  abstract    = {This paper provides evidence from the US and Denmark that managers with a business degree (“business managers”) reduce their employees' wages. Within five years of the appointment of a business manager, wages decline by 6% and the labor share by 5 percentage points in the US, and by 3% and 3 percentage points in Denmark. Firms appointing business managers are not on differential trends and do not enjoy higher output, investment, or employment growth thereafter. Using manager retirements and deaths and an IV strategy based on the diffusion of the practice of appointing business managers within industry, region and size quartile cells, we provide additional evidence that these are causal effects. We establish that the proximate cause of these (relative) wage effects are changes in rent-sharing practices following the appointment of business managers. Exploiting exogenous export demand shocks, we show that non-business managers share profits with their workers, whereas business managers do not. But consistent with our first set of results, these business managers show no greater ability to increase sales or profits in response to exporting opportunities. Finally, we use the influence of role models on college major choice to instrument for the decision to enroll in a business degree in Denmark and show that our estimates correspond to causal effects of practices and values acquired in business education - rather than the differential selection into business education of individuals unlikely to share rents with workers.},

  abstract    = {The view that empirical strategies in economics should be transparent and credible now goes almost without saying. The local average treatment effects (LATE) framework for causal inference helped make this so. The LATE theorem tells us for whom particular instrumental variables (IV) and regression discontinuity estimates are valid. This lecture uses several empirical examples, mostly involving charter and exam schools, to highlight the value of LATE. A surprising exclusion restriction, an assumption central to the LATE interpretation of IV estimates, is shown to explain why enrollment at Chicago exam schools reduces student achievement. I also make two broader points: IV exclusion restrictions formalize commitment to clear and consistent explanations of reduced-form causal effects; compelling applications demonstrate the power of simple empirical strategies to generate new causal knowledge.},

  abstract     = {Deterministic variables are variables that are fully explained by one or more parent variables. They commonly arise when a variable has been algebraically constructed from one or more parent variables, as with composite variables, and in compositional data, where the 'whole' variable is determined from its 'parts'. This article introduces how deterministic variables may be depicted within directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to help with identifying and interpreting causal effects involving tautological associations, compositional data, and composite variables. We propose a two-step approach in which all variables are initially considered, and an explicit choice is then made whether to focus on the deterministic variable(s) or the determining parents. Depicting deterministic variables within DAGs bring several benefits. It is easier to identify and avoid misinterpreting tautological associations, i.e., self-fulfilling associations between variables with shared algebraic parent variables. In compositional data, it is easier to understand the consequences of conditioning on the 'whole' variable, and correctly identify total and relative causal effects. For composite variables, it encourages greater consideration of the target estimand and greater scrutiny of the consistency and exchangeability assumptions. DAGs with deterministic variables are a useful aid for planning and interpreting analyses involving tautological associations, compositional data, and/or composite variables.},

  abstract    = {Political scientists have acknowledged the importance of ethno-nationalism as a constitutive element of radical-right politics, but have typically empirically reduced the phenomenon to its downstream attitudinal correlates. Sociologists, on the other hand, have extensively studied nationalism, but have rarely weighed in on debates about institutional politics. In this study, we bring these literatures together by considering how nationalist beliefs shaped respondents{\textquoteright} voting preferences in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and how the election outcome built on long-term changes in the distribution of nationalism in the U.S. population. The results suggest that competing understandings of American nationhood were effectively mobilized by candidates from the two parties, both in the 2016 primaries and the general election. Furthermore, over the past twenty years, nationalism has become sorted by party, as Republican identifiers have become predominantly ethno-nationalist and Democrats have increasingly endorsed creedal and disengaged conceptions of nationhood. This points to the rising demand for radical candidates among Republicans and suggests a potentially bleak future for U.S. politics, as nationalism becomes yet another among multiple overlapping social and cultural cleavages that serve to reinforce deep partisan divisions and undermine the stability of liberal democratic institutions.},

  abstract    = {In this chapter, we review the class of causal effects based on incremental propensity scores interventions proposed by Kennedy [2019]. The aim of incremental propensity score interventions is to estimate the effect of increasing or decreasing subjects' odds of receiving treatment; this differs from the average treatment effect, where the aim is to estimate the effect of everyone deterministically receiving versus not receiving treatment. We first present incremental causal effects for the case when there is a single binary treatment, such that it can be compared to average treatment effects and thus shed light on key concepts. In particular, a benefit of incremental effects is that positivity - a common assumption in causal inference - is not needed to identify causal effects. Then we discuss the more general case where treatment is measured at multiple time points, where positivity is more likely to be violated and thus incremental effects can be especially useful. Throughout, we motivate incremental effects with real-world applications, present nonparametric estimators for these effects, and discuss their efficiency properties, while also briefly reviewing the role of influence functions in functional estimation. Finally, we show how to interpret and analyze results using these estimators in practice, and discuss extensions and future directions.},

  abstract     = {This study explores how researchers’ analytical choices affect the reliability of scientific findings. Most discussions of reliability problems in science focus on systematic biases. We broaden the lens to emphasize the idiosyncrasy of conscious and unconscious decisions that researchers make during data analysis. We coordinated 161 researchers in 73 research teams and observed their research decisions as they used the same data to independently test the same prominent social science hypothesis: that greater immigration reduces support for social policies among the public. In this typical case of social science research, research teams reported both widely diverging numerical findings and substantive conclusions despite identical start conditions. Researchers’ expertise, prior beliefs, and expectations barely predict the wide variation in research outcomes. More than 95\% of the total variance in numerical results remains unexplained even after qualitative coding of all identifiable decisions in each team’s workflow. This reveals a universe of uncertainty that remains hidden when considering a single study in isolation. The idiosyncratic nature of how researchers’ results and conclusions varied is a previously underappreciated explanation for why many scientific hypotheses remain contested. These results call for greater epistemic humility and clarity in reporting scientific findings.},

  abstract    = {We provide a comprehensive analysis of income inequality and income dynamics for Germany over the last two decades. Combining personal income tax and social security data allows us – for the first time – to offer a complete picture of the distribution of annual earnings in Germany. We find that cross-sectional inequality rose until 2009 for men and women. After the Great Recession inequality continued to rise at a slower rate for men and fell slightly for women due to compression at the lower tail. We further document substantial gender differences in average earnings and inequality over the life-cycle. While for men earnings rise and inequality falls as they grow older, many women reduce working hours when starting a family such that average earnings fall and inequality increases. Men’s earnings changes are on average smaller than women’s but are substantially more affected by the business cycle. During the Great Recession, men’s earnings losses become magnified and gains are attenuated. Apart from recession years, earnings changes are significantly right-skewed reflecting the good overall state of the German labor market and increasing labor supply. In the second part of the paper, we study the distribution of total income including incomes of self-employed, business owners, and landlords. We find that total inequality increased significantly more than earnings inequality. Regarding income dynamics, entrepreneurs’ income changes are more dispersed, less skewed, less leptokurtic and less dependent on average past income than workers’ income changes. Finally, we find that top income earners have become less likely to fall out of the top 1 and 0.1 percent.},

Der vorliegende Beitrag geht der Frage nach, ob das von Rokkan und Lipset konzipierte Konfliktlinienmodell (cleavage) noch einen Beitrag zur Erklärung des Wahlverhaltens im neuen, größeren Deutschland leisten kann. Bei der Prüfung der Theorie stützen sich die Autoren hauptsächlich auf die Daten der Forschungsgruppe Wahlen und das ZDF-Politbarometer. Die gesellschaftlichen Subsysteme bergen nach Lipset/Rokkan folgende Konfliktpotentiale in sich, die in dem Parteiensystem ihren Niederschlag finden: die Spaltung Besitz-Arbeit, die Spaltung Staat-Kirche, die Spaltung Stadt-Land und die Ethnische/Linguistische Spaltung. Die Sekundäranalyse zeigt, daß die Theorie sozialstrukturell verankerter Konfliktlinien als Determinanten des Wahlverhaltens nach wie vor einen eigenständigen Beitrag zur Erklärung der individuellen Parteipräferenzen in Deutschland zu leisten vermag. (pmb)'Electoral behavior in West Germany on state and federal levels was characterized by remarkable stability until the late 80's. This could be explained for a long time by the so called 'cleavage theory' of Stein Rokkan and Seymour Martin Lipset which says that the more or less frozen party systems of western democraties are based on sociostructural conflicts in these societies. Since the late 80's we report a clear drop in the stability of voting results. In addition, the unification of the two german states raises the question whether the cleavage model still can explain individual party preferences although voters in West and East were brought up in very different social and political structures. To answer this question we analyse party preferences in West and East separately as well as for the whole unified Germany. It will be clear that even under the changed conditions of the united Germany the model of Lipset and Rokkan can still contribute an independent part of the explanation of voting behavior.'

  abstract    = {We use population data on capital income and wealth holdings for Norway to measure asset positions and wealth returns before individuals marry and after the household is formed. These data allow us to establish a number of novel facts. First, individuals sort on personal wealth rather than parents' wealth. Assortative mating on own wealth dominates, and in fact renders assortative mating on parental wealth statistically insignificant. Second, people match also on their personal returns to wealth and assortative mating on returns is as strong as that on wealth. Third, post-marriage returns on family wealth are largely explained by the return of the spouse with the highest pre-marriage return. This suggests that family wealth is largely managed by the spouse with the highest potential to grow it. This is particularly true for households at the top of the wealth distribution at marriage. We use a simple analytical example to illustrate how assortative mating on wealth and returns and wealth management task allocation between spouses affect wealth inequality.},

  abstract    = {This paper examines the econometric causal model for policy analysis developed by the seminal ideas of Ragnar Frisch and Trygve Haavelmo. We compare the econometric causal model with two popular causal frameworks: Neyman-Holland causal model and the do-calculus. The Neyman-Holland causal model is based on the language of potential outcomes and was largely developed by statisticians. The do-calculus, developed by Judea Pearl and co-authors, relies on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and is a popular causal framework in computer science. We make the case that economists who uncritically use these approximating frameworks often discard the substantial benefits of the econometric causal model to the detriment of more informative economic policy analyses. We illustrate the versatility and capabilities of the econometric framework using causal models that are frequently studied by economists.},

  abstract    = {Control variables are included in regression analyses to estimate the causal effect of a treatment on an outcome. In this article, we argue that the estimated effect sizes of control variables are unlikely to have a causal interpretation themselves though. This is because even valid controls are possibly endogenous and therefore represent a combination of several different causal mechanisms operating jointly on the outcome, which is hard to interpret theoretically. We recommend to refrain from reporting marginal effects of controls in regression tables and to focus exclusively on the variables of interest in the results sections of quantitative research papers. Moreover, we advise against using control variable estimates for subsequent theory building and meta-analyses.},

  abstract  = {General methods have been developed for estimating causal effects from observational data under causal assumptions encoded in the form of a causal graph. Most of this literature assumes that the underlying causal graph is completely specified. However, only observational data is available in most practical settings, which means that one can learn at most a Markov equivalence class (MEC) of the underlying causal graph. In this paper, we study the problem of causal estimation from a MEC represented by a partial ancestral graph (PAG), which is learnable from observational data. We develop a general estimator for any identifiable causal effects in a PAG. The result fills a gap for an end-to-end solution to causal inference from observational data to effects estimation. Specifically, we develop a complete identification algorithm that derives an influence function for any identifiable causal effects from PAGs. We then construct a double/debiased machine learning (DML) estimator that is robust to model misspecification and biases in nuisance function estimation, permitting the use of modern machine learning techniques. Simulation results corroborate with the theory.},

  abstract    = {The spread in the use of tracking systems in sport has made fine-grained spatiotemporal analysis a primary focus of an emerging sports analytics industry. Recently publicized tracking data for men's professional tennis allows for the first detailed spatial analysis of return impact. Mixture models are an appealing model-based framework for spatial analysis in sport, where latent variable discovery is often of primary interest. Although finite mixture models have the advantages of interpretability and scalability, most implementations assume standard parametric distributions for outcomes conditioned on latent variables. In this paper, we present a more flexible alternative that allows the latent conditional distribution to be a mixed member of finite Gaussian mixtures. Our model was motivated by our efforts to describe common styles of return impact location of professional tennis players and is the reason we name the approach a 'latent style allocation' model. In a fully Bayesian implementation, we apply the model to 142,803 return points played by 141 top players at Association of Tennis Professional events between 2018 and 2020 and show that the latent style allocation improves predictive performance over a finite Gaussian mixture model and identifies six unique impact styles on the first and second serve return.},

Whilst it should be accessible to anyone with a basic understanding of machine learning techniques, it was originally written for research students, and focuses on issues that are of particular concern within academic research, such as the need to do rigorous comparisons and reach valid conclusions. It covers five stages of the machine learning process: what to do before model building, how to reliably build models, how to robustly evaluate models, how to compare models fairly, and how to report results.},

  abstract    = {In most national elections, voters face a key choice between continuity and change. Electoral turnovers occur when the incumbent candidate or party fails to win reelection. To understand how turnovers affect national outcomes, we study the universe of presidential and parliamentary elections held since 1945. We document the prevalence of turnovers over time and we estimate their effects on economic performance, trade, human development, conflict, and democracy. Using a close-elections regression discontinuity design (RDD) across countries, we show that turnovers improve country performance. These effects are not driven by differences in the characteristics of challengers, or by the fact that challengers systematically increase the level of government intervention in the economy. Electing new leaders leads to more policy change, it improves governance, and it reduces perceived corruption, consistent with the expectation that recently elected leaders exert more effort due to stronger reputation concerns.},

Decision-making that relies on tradition can be an effective strategy and arises in equilibrium. While dynamically optimal, it generates static `mismatch.' When the world changes, since traits evolve slowly, they may not be beneficial in their new environment. I discuss how mismatch helps explain the world around us, presents special challenges and opportunities for policy, and provides important lessons for our future as a human species.},

It shows how causality has grown from a nebulous concept into a mathematical theory with significant applications in the fields of statistics, artificial intelligence, economics, philosophy, cognitive science, and the health and social sciences. Judea Pearl presents and unifies the probabilistic, manipulative, counterfactual, and structural approaches to causation and devises simple mathematical tools for studying the relationships between causal connections and statistical associations. Cited in more than 2,100 scientific publications, it continues to liberate scientists from the traditional molds of statistical thinking. In this revised edition, Judea Pearl elucidates thorny issues, answers readers' questions, and offers a panoramic view of recent advances in this field of research. Causality will be of interest to students and professionals in a wide variety of fields. Dr Judea Pearl has received the 2011 Rumelhart Prize for his leading research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and systems from The Cognitive Science Society.},

  title     = {Causal Inference in Statistics. A Primer},
  abstract  = {Causality is central to the understanding and use of data. Without an understanding of cause–effect relationships, we cannot use data to answer questions as basic as \enquote{Does this treatment harm or help patients?} But though hundreds of introductory texts are available on statistical methods of data analysis, until now, no beginner-level book has been written about the exploding arsenal of methods that can tease causal information from data.

Causal Inference in Statistics fills that gap. Using simple examples and plain language, the book lays out how to define causal parameters; the assumptions necessary to estimate causal parameters in a variety of situations; how to express those assumptions mathematically; whether those assumptions have testable implications; how to predict the effects of interventions; and how to reason counterfactually. These are the foundational tools that any student of statistics needs to acquire in order to use statistical methods to answer causal questions of interest.

This book is accessible to anyone with an interest in interpreting data, from undergraduates, professors, researchers, or to the interested layperson. Examples are drawn from a wide variety of fields, including medicine, public policy, and law; a brief introduction to probability and statistics is provided for the uninitiated; and each chapter comes with study questions to reinforce the readers understanding.},

Hansen (2021b) corrects this theorem. As a result, all theorems in the latter version coincide with the above mentioned classical theorems. Furthermore, we also show that the theorems in Hansen (2022) (the version published in Econometrica) either coincide with the classical theorems just mentioned, or contain extra assumptions that are alien to the Gauss-Markov or Aitken Theorem.},

While Austria is an important case for Lipset and Rokkan’s classic cleavage theory, they overlooked the long evolution of its
party system pre-WWI. This paper introduces the Habsburg Manifesto Dataset (HMD), demonstrating its usefulness by
tracking the formation of Imperial Austrian party system cleavages under universal manhood suffrage. Based on the
qualitative content analysis of historical electoral manifestos, HMD measures the policy offers and group appeals made by
Imperial Austria’s German and Czech parties. This allows testing Lipset and Rokkan’s claims by applying contemporary
methodologies to a case that was effectively excluded from their original analysis. Doing so reveals a surprising degree of
structure: parties consistently combined issue and group claims around center-periphery, class, and state-church cleavages.},
